# 📘 Kannada Teacher – A Progressive Web App for Everyone

**Kannada Teacher** is an open-source, mobile-first web app designed to help non-Kannada speakers learn Kannada through English. Built with ❤️ in Angular, this app is optimized for offline use, respects user privacy, and requires **no sign-in**. All user data is stored locally on their device, making it a safe, fast, and convenient experience.

## 🌟 Why This Exists

This project is born out of good will. Kannada is a beautiful language spoken by millions, but many who live or travel in Karnataka struggle to pick it up due to a lack of accessible, simple, and friendly learning tools. This app aims to change that – **by making Kannada learning easy, free, and open to everyone.**

Whether you're a student, a migrant worker, a tourist, or just curious – this is for you.
